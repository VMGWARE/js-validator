## Reporting a Vulnerability

The safety and security of JS Validator is a top priority. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any version of JS Validator, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do Not Post It Publicly**: Please do not post vulnerabilities publicly on forums, social media, or other platforms. We want to mitigate any potential harm to users by keeping the issue confidential until a fix is available.

2. **Email Your Report**: Send an email to the security team at `security@vmgware.dev`. Include a detailed report of the vulnerability, including the affected version, potential impact, and any steps to reproduce it. If possible, provide suggestions for how the vulnerability can be mitigated or fixed.

3. **Wait for Response**: We will review your report and respond as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience as we work to confirm and address the vulnerability.

4. **Disclosure Timing**: Please allow us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before any public disclosure. We aim to handle all security reports with the utmost urgency and care.

5. **Acknowledgment**: Contributors who report a valid security vulnerability will be acknowledged in the project's release notes, once the issue has been resolved. If you wish to remain anonymous, please let us know in your report.

## Security Patch Process

Upon receiving a security vulnerability report, our team will:

1. Confirm the vulnerability and determine its severity.
2. Develop a security patch or workaround.
3. Test the patch to ensure it effectively resolves the vulnerability without introducing new issues.
4. Release an updated version of JS Validator with the patch.
5. Publicly disclose the details of the vulnerability and its fix, acknowledging the reporter (unless anonymity is requested).

- **Review Validation Rules**: Regularly review your validation rules and configurations to ensure they meet your current security requirements.
